# Rice Disease Classification Tool
## Overview
This project implements a feature on a web page that identifies whether crops are infected with diseases or pests. All computations are performed within the browser. The model uses ShuffleNetV2, and the frontend is built with React.

## Personal Project
This is an independent project developed to address the need for accessible and efficient crop disease identification.

## Technical Stack
- Model Training: PyTorch was used for training the model.
- Browser Compatibility: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) was utilized to enable the model to operate in a browser environment.
- Frontend Development: The frontend is designed with HTML and CSS.
## Innovations
To facilitate the model's operation in a browser, it was converted to the ONNX format. This conversion significantly simplifies the deployment of the model outside of a Python environment, enabling direct inference on the browser.
